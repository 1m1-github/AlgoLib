# AlgoLib
library of useful smart contracts  

using the Algorand ABI, dApps can benefit from a library of often used calculations  

functions should be as modular as possible  


## e.g.  
approximate sin(x)  
approximate a^b, where a and b can be rational (encoded in 2 uint fields)  
elliptic curve algebra  

## notes

needs versioning of the AlgoLib smart contracts  
(a good standard could be created here)  

there should be a process for auditing each function  
(audit could be a 0 ALGO txn) with a note  
(audit framework could actually be a separate project)
