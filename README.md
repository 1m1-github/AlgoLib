# AlgoLib
library for useful smart contracts

using the Algorand ABI, dApps can benefit from a library of often used calculation of smart contracts

there should be a process for auditing each function
(audit could be a 0 ALGO txn) with a note)

functions should be as modular as possible

needs versioning of the calc smart contracts
(„ÖÅ good standard could be created here)

e.g.
approximate sin(x)
approximate a^b, where a and b can be rational (encoded in 2 uint fields)
